# Outlr PSE Project
## Documents and Presentations

Outlr is a PSE (Praxis der Softwareentwicklung) project developed at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology during the winter semester of 2022/23.
This repo contains the documents and presentations of all project phases.
Some of the documents in this repository were slightly improved after the submission deadline.
The implementation document and the test report are rather short. The focus in these phases of our project was on the code.

The documents are based on this template (https://git.scc.kit.edu/IPDSnelting/pflichtenheft).

You are free to use everything in this repo.
