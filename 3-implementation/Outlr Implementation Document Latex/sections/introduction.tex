\section{Introduction}
This document intends to provide a basic overview of the implementation phase. In the phase, which this document covers, we implemented our implementation plan from the design phase, which was based on the software requirements specification we created in the first phase. 

The document first explains our workflow in this phase, then covers our planned procedure of implementing "Outlr." for which we assigned each package a desired starting and ending date. This is followed by a Gantt chart displaying the actual procedure by displaying the actual starting and ending dates of each package implementation.
After that, data related to our implementation is presented.

Then the product functions and requirements defined in the software requirements specification are covered. For the product functions as well as for the requirements this document lists, which of these were implemented and which were not - looking at mandatory and optional product functions/ requirements separately. For the product functions/requirements, which were not implemented, the reason is explained. 

Lastly, after listing the libraries/frameworks used as well as giving an overview of unit tests the faced problems and deviations from the implementations are covered.
