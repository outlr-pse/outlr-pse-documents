\section{Problems faced}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Difficulties setting up the CI/CD pipeline 
    \par Due to not having enough permissions on the SCC server and our Gitlab repository, our team faced difficulties setting up a proper CI/CD environment. This resulted in the postponed completion of some previously scheduled tasks.
    
    \item 
    Missing definition of JSONs
    \par
    We did not precisely define JSON requests and responses between the front-end and the back-end in the design phase. This was made up for in the implementation phase. Since the models have many references to each other defining the JSON structure was a difficult task. For these reasons, implementing the models took more time than expected.
    
    \item 
    Difficulties estimating how long tasks take to implement
    \par Tasks took longer than expected as can be deduced from the difference between the planned timeline and the timeline depicting the actual procedure

    \item
    Getting used to new tools\par
    Although \gls{python} and \gls{typescript} are relatively easy to learn it took the team some time to get used to. Additionally, working with frameworks like \gls{vue-js}, \gls{flask}, and \gls{SQLAlchemy} made it difficult to predict how long tasks take. Implementing the models using \gls{SQLAlchemy} took much more time than expected.
