\section{Code Quality}

Static code analysis is an effective method for detecting defects and vulnerabilities in software code. It involves the use of automated tools to analyze code without actually executing it. One of the most common types of static analysis is linting, which checks code for syntax errors, style violations, and other potential issues. Our Code now has 0 lint issues.
